## Are missing data at random or on purpose? A spatial take with Radom Forest (cladag '23) 

SWO -R (reliable)- D (where R stands for reliable) has the potential to revolutionize the way we approach socio-economic applications. This paper will discuss the implications of intentionally or randomly (?) missing data on public Italian procurement, and how this can be addressed using spatial statistics/econometrics tools to uncover hidden patterns. We will discuss the challenges posed by the lack of data, and quality needs to be introduced in the vocabulary of Italian Open Procurement Data. We will also explore how SWORD can be used to improve decision-making in public procurement, and how it can be used to ensure that all parties involved are aware of the risks associated with missing data. Finally, we will discuss analysis results using ANAC data.

## about CLADAG

The **CLA**ssification and **D**ata **A**nalysis **G**roup (**CLADAG**) of the Italian Statistical Society (SIS) promotes advanced methodological research in multivariate statistics with a special vocation in Data Analysis and Classification. CLADAG supports the interchange of ideas in these fields of research, including the dissemination of concepts, numerical methods, algorithms, computational and applied results.
CLADAG is a member of the International Federation of Classification Societies (IFCS). Among its activities, CLADAG organizes a biennial international scientific meeting, schools related to classification and data analysis, publishes a newsletter, and cooperates with other member societies of the IFCS to the organization of their conferences. Founded in 1985, the IFCS is a federation of national, regional, and linguistically-based classification societies. It is a non-profit, nonpolitical scientific organization, whose aims are to further classification research.

Previous CLADAG meetings were held in Pescara (1997), Roma (1999), Palermo (2001), Bologna (2003), Parma (2005), Macerata (2007), Catania (2009), Pavia (2011), Modena and Reggio Emilia (2013), Cagliari (2015), Milano (2017), Cassino (2019) and Firenze (2021).
